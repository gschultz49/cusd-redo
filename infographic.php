           <p>After eating their nutritious meals, whatever nutrients the elephants were not able to digest gets turned into waste. This is known as organic waste, since it contains lots of carbon and nitrogen. Each elephant can produce up to 300 pounds of waste a day! </p>

           <h3> Elephants generate the waste!</h3>
           <p>A few times a week, the elephant waste is transported to a composter at the Zoo. In the composter, microbes, bacteria uses air and water to breaks down the organic waste and turns into compost. This process generates heat, which could be captured for other uses. </p>
