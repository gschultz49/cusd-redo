          <p>Many items that usually get thrown out can actually be recycled. Recycling keeps waste out of landfills, oceans, and other natural habitats where it can be harmful to the ecosystems. Recycling allows waste to get turned into new products like furntature, bottles, and many more. Many towns and cities will pick up recycling or have designated locations to drop off recycling. </p>
